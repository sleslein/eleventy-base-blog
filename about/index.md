Hi! I'm Shea. I'm a born and raised Iowan living in foreign lands, aka, Chicagoland. Since graduating from Iowa State Univerity, I've devoted myself to a life as a software engineer, father, husband, and follower of Jesus. It's all busy, but I wouldn't change it for the world!

I created this blog to share about all of the things I'm devoted to. Maybe we have something in common and my experiences and perspectives will help you out someday! The next best thing would be if I can Google myself for an answer I have forgotten!
