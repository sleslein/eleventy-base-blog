- [ ] Explain why mediditation is important/essential skill

The ABC method is a very effective method for meditating on scripture and building a strong daily quite time habit. I first encountered this method during the [Every Man a Warrior](https://everymanawarrior.com/) discipleship study.  The method is both simple and effective! Not surprising "ABC" is an acronym.  The letters of the acrostic represent the three steps of the method: ask questions, best verse and thoughts, communicate with God. It's best to follow the ABC method by actively writing down thoughts and ideas on paper. The Every Man a Warrior provides a helpful [Quite Time Log](https://everymanawarrior.com/file_download/20b04bcd-d44a-4e00-8cc5-19e462109830) for this reason.

## Ask Questions
As you read a passage of scripture, **ask questions.** What questions?  Well just like a good journalist you should start by asking the traditional 5 W's (who, what, when, where, why) and how. Identify who is involved in the passage. Carefully consider where and when the passage is occurring. Finally, consider why the topic has come up at all.  These questions will help you gain a better grasp of the context of the passage. It's often helpful to use a study Bible or read an accompanying commentary to suppliment the text itself.  These addtional context provided by these jounalistic questions are key to helping intruput the next more valuable set of questions. The next set of questions will uncover imporant information we can apply to our lives.

Every passage of scripture will answer one of the following questions.
- Is there a command to obey?
- Is there a promise to claim?
- Is there a sin to avoid?
- Is there an application to make?
- What does does this reveal about God himself?

## Best Verse and Thoughts
It's essential that we not only actively read the passage by asking good questions, but that we try to cement what's been learned in our hearts and minds.  That's there the **best verse and thoughts** step comes in play.  Its important to have that pen and paper handy for this step.  Identify the verse which most resonated with you during your reading.  Rewrite this verse in your own words.  Then jot down some additional thoughts about the verse or passage.  This step will help turn the head knowldege to heart knowledge.
